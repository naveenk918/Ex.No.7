## **Aim**

To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.
---

## **Apparatus Required**

- Python 3.x  
- ChatGPT (OpenAI API / Web Interface)  
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) or Chatbot Interface  
- Text Editor (VS Code / PyCharm)  
- GitHub Repository for version control  

---

## **Procedure**

### **Step 1: Define Core Functionalities**

- Add, view, delete, and prioritize daily tasks  
- Schedule reminders using natural language  
- Generate quick wellness or motivational tips  
- Respond to general user queries  
- Learn user preferences and adapt responses accordingly  

This step helps define the purpose of the application clearly, making it easier to design appropriate prompts later.

---

### **Step 2: Construct Prompts for Each Feature**

#### **A. Task Manager**
Handles user’s daily to-do lists effectively.  
**Example Prompts:**
- “Add a new task: Complete the VLSI lab report by 6 PM.”  
- “What are my remaining tasks for today?”  
- “Delete the task ‘Call electrician.’”  

---

#### **B. Scheduler**
Helps users set and manage meetings or events.  
**Example Prompts:**
- “Schedule a team meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.”  
- “Do I have any free time after 3 PM today?”  
- “Add an event: Doctor appointment at 8 AM on Friday.”  

---

#### **C. Wellness Tips**
Provides daily well-being or motivational suggestions.  
**Example Prompts:**
- “Give me a short wellness tip for today.”  
- “Suggest a quick relaxation exercise.”  
- “Remind me to drink water every two hours.”  

---

#### **D. General Queries**
Responds to general questions from users.  
**Example Prompts:**
- “What’s the weather forecast for tomorrow morning?”  
- “Summarize my weekly schedule in three bullet points.”  
- “Give me a motivational quote to start my day.”  

---

### **Step 3: Simulate User Interaction**

A **CLI or chatbot interface** was created for interaction.  
The user inputs a prompt, which ChatGPT processes and returns a structured, human-like response.  
This demonstrates how natural language can be used for efficient task automation.

---

### **Step 4: Feedback and Adaptive Learning**

User feedback was integrated to improve the assistant:
- If a suggestion was not useful, it was avoided next time.  
- Frequently used task types were prioritized.  
- A **local memory file (JSON/CSV)** stored preferences to refine future responses.  

---

### **Step 5: Integration of Basic Memory (Optional)**

A simple memory system stored user data such as tasks, schedules, and tips.  
Over time, the assistant became more personalized, offering relevant recommendations and reminders automatically.

---

## **Expected Output**

### ✅ **Personal Task Manager**
- Accepts tasks using natural language  
- Organizes by priority and deadline  
- Provides daily/weekly summaries  

### ✅ **Smart Scheduler**
- Detects overlapping events  
- Suggests best available free slots  

### ✅ **Wellness Tip Generator**
- Offers daily health or motivation tips  
- Learns user preferences for better suggestions  

### ✅ **General Query Support**
- Handles common information requests  
- Summarizes schedules concisely  

---

## **Result**

The experiment successfully produced a **prototype of a prompt-based personal assistant** using ChatGPT.  
Through this exercise, students were able to:

- Understand the use of **prompt engineering** for real-world problem solving  
- Apply creativity to design personalized AI features  
- Learn structured interaction with language models  
- Explore how **generative AI** can assist in daily productivity and time management  

This experiment strengthened the understanding of **AI-driven automation** and **adaptive prompt design**, showcasing the power of large language models in everyday applications.
